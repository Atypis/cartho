# Article 5: Prohibited AI Practices - Structure Notes

## Critical Discovery: Text Anomaly

The source text appears to have gaps:
- Art 5(1)(a): Subliminal/manipulative techniques ✓
- Art 5(1)(b): Exploitation of vulnerabilities ✓
- Art 5(1)(c): MISSING in visible text - jumps to (i)(ii) numbering suggesting social scoring
- Art 5(1)(d): Criminal risk assessment ✓
- Art 5(1)(e): Facial recognition database scraping ✓
- Art 5(1)(f): Emotion inference workplace/education ✓
- Art 5(1)(g): Biometric categorization sensitive attributes ✓
- Art 5(1)(h): MISSING but referenced extensively in paragraphs 2-7 - appears to be real-time remote biometric identification with exceptions

**Action Required**: Need to read surrounding context or search for (c) and (h) text

## Structural Observation

Article 5 has two-tier structure:

### Tier 1: Absolute Prohibitions (most of 5(1))
- Banned AI practices
- No exceptions or limited exceptions

### Tier 2: Conditional Prohibition with Exceptions (Art 5(1)(h) + 5(2)-(7))
- Real-time remote biometric identification
- Prohibited UNLESS strict conditions met
- Requires prior authorization, fundamental rights assessment
- Member State opt-in with detailed procedural rules

## Logical Structure Pattern

Each prohibition follows pattern:
```
Prohibited Activity: [placing on market, putting into service, OR use]
OF: [specific AI system type/purpose]
WITH/FOR: [specific objective or effect]
CAUSING: [specific harm]
EXCEPTION: [if any]
```

## Confidence Issues

Many prohibitions contain highly interpretative language:
- "materially distorting"
- "appreciably impairing"
- "significant harm"
- "reasonably likely to cause"
- "vulnerabilities"
- "unjustified or disproportionate"

These will require LLM evaluation with context.

## Next Steps

1. Find complete text of 5(1)(c) and 5(1)(h)
2. Map each prohibition with full cumulative elements
3. Map 5(2)-(7) procedural regime for biometric identification
4. Create decision trees for each prohibition
