# Cartography Framework Docs

Current approach:
- Timestamp conceptual/approach docs in the filename (e.g., `2025-10-10-...`).
- Keep older/superseded docs under `cartography-framework/deprecated/`.

Key files:
- `2025-10-10-PRESCRIPTIVE-NORM-MODELING-APPROACH.md` — latest modeling approach.
- `PRESCRIPTIVE-NORMS-CONCEPT.md` — concept for prescriptive norms.
- `PRESCRIPTIVE-NORMS-CATALOG.md` — comprehensive PN catalogue.
- `PN-HIGH-LEVEL-REQUIREMENTS.md` — high-level Prüfschema for PNs.
- `deprecated/` — older approaches (Wirknormen, early cartography notes, older schema drafts).

Convention going forward:
- New conceptual/approach docs: prefix with `YYYY-MM-DD-`.
- When superseding a document, move the older one to `deprecated/` (keep filename). Add a brief deprecation note at the top.
