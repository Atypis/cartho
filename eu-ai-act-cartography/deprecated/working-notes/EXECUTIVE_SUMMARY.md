# Executive Summary: Legal Cartography Project

## What Was Built

A **proof-of-concept legal cartography system** for the EU AI Act that:

1. **Maps legislation systematically** as nested requirement trees with confidence ratings
2. **Combines deterministic + probabilistic evaluation** (rules + LLM interpretation)
3. **Provides complete traceability** for every legal determination
4. **Enables human oversight** with reviewable LLM reasoning

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Comprehensive EU AI Act Mapping

**Completed:**
- ✅ **Scope Architecture** (Article 1-2): 7 pathways, 12 exclusions mapped
- ✅ **All 68 Definitions** (Article 3): Complete with interdependencies
- ✅ **Prohibited Practices** (Article 5): All 8 prohibitions + procedural regimes
- ✅ **High-Risk Classification** (Article 6-7): Complete decision logic
- ✅ **Annex III**: All 25 high-risk use cases across 8 areas
- ✅ **Article 9 Complete**: Risk management with full 5-layer threshold chain

**File Count:**
- 10+ definition files
- 2 consequence/obligation files
- 1 comprehensive annex mapping
- Session notes and progress tracking

**Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "layer_0_scope": "7 alternative pathways",
  "layer_1_material": "AI system definition",
  "layer_2_exclusions": "12 exclusions mapped",
  "layer_3_actors": "6 actor types",
  "layer_4_classification": "High-risk logic tree",
  "layer_5_obligations": "e.g., Article 9 risk management"
}
```

### 2. Evaluation Engine

**Components:**
- `engine.py`: Core evaluation logic with tree walking
- `visualizer.py`: HTML + ASCII decision tree generation
- `interactive_cli.py`: User-friendly command-line interface
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies

**Capabilities:**
- Load cartography JSON
- Build evaluation trees
- Apply rule-based logic for HIGH confidence nodes
- Flag LOW confidence nodes for LLM evaluation
- Aggregate confidence scores
- Generate visual reports

**Example Output:**
```
Result: HIGH-RISK ⚠️
Confidence: 87%

Decision Tree:
✓ Scope applies (95%)
  ✓ Provider in EU (100%)
  ✓ System is AI (90%)
✓ High-risk classification (85%)
  ✓ Matches Annex III 4(a) - recruitment (95%)
  ✓ Materially influences decisions [LLM] (75%)
    → System filters 80% of candidates...
```

## Methodology: Legal Cartography v0.1

### Core Innovation

**Traditional Legal Analysis:**
```
"Does Article 9 apply?" → Lawyer reads entire Act → "Yes/No/Maybe"
```

**Legal Cartography:**
```
"Does Article 9 apply?"
  → Evaluate Layer 0 (Scope): Yes [95% confidence]
  → Evaluate Layer 1 (AI System): Yes [88% confidence]
  → Evaluate Layer 2 (High-Risk): Yes [85% confidence]
    → Pathway 6(2): Annex III
      → Area 4(a): Recruitment ✓
      → Article 6(3) opt-out? [LLM evaluation]
        → "Not narrow procedural task" → No opt-out [80% confidence]
  → Evaluate Layer 3 (Provider): Yes [95% confidence]
  → Result: Article 9 APPLIES [87% overall confidence]
```

### Key Features

1. **Explicit Confidence Tracking**
   - Every node: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
   - Aggregate up the tree
   - Highlight weak points

2. **LLM for Interpretation**
   - "Significant risk" → LLM with context
   - "Materially influencing" → LLM with case facts
   - "Reasonably foreseeable" → LLM with industry norms

3. **Human Oversight**
   - Review all LLM reasoning
   - Override any determination
   - Document rationale

4. **Reusable Components**
   - Shared nodes (scope, definitions)
   - Single source of truth
   - Cross-referenced provisions

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Threshold Chains Are Deep

**Article 9 requires satisfying 5 layers BEFORE substantive requirements:**
- Layer 0: EU AI Act applies (scope + no exclusions)
- Layer 1: System is "AI system"
- Layer 2: System is "high-risk"
- Layer 3: Actor is "provider"
- Layer 4: Temporal trigger met

**Implication**: Most obligations have extensive prerequisites. Can't evaluate in isolation.

### 2. ~40% of Act Requires Interpretation

**HIGH Confidence (rule-based):**
- Definitions (mostly)
- Scope pathways
- Temporal triggers
- Actor classifications

**LOW Confidence (LLM-needed):**
- "Significant risk" (undefined)
- "Materially influencing" (threshold unclear)
- "Reasonably foreseeable misuse" (context-dependent)
- "Acceptable residual risk" (no numeric threshold)
- "Appropriate" testing (sector-specific)

### 3. Profiling = Automatic High-Risk

**Article 6(3) second subparagraph:**
> "An AI system referred to in Annex III shall ALWAYS be considered to be high-risk where the AI system performs profiling"

**No opt-out possible** → Critical bright-line rule

### 4. Provider Defines Purpose, Cascades Throughout

**Article 3(12):** Provider's documentation defines "intended purpose"

**Cascading effects:**
- Risk management scope (Art 9)
- Testing requirements (Art 9(6))
- Misuse boundaries (Art 3(13))
- Performance expectations (Art 15)
- Deployer information (Art 13)

**Implication**: Provider controls critical definitional anchor

### 5. Real-Time Biometric = Most Complex

**Article 5(1)(h):** Prohibited EXCEPT narrow exceptions

**Procedural requirements if exception applies:**
- Prior judicial/administrative authorization
- Fundamental rights impact assessment
- Registration in EU database
- Notification to authorities
- Necessity & proportionality test
- No sole decision-making
- Member State opt-in required
- Annual reporting

**Implication**: Even "permitted" use has 8+ mandatory safeguards

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: CV Screening Tool

**Input:**
```json
{
  "system_description": "AI automatically filters job applications",
  "provider": "TechCorp GmbH",
  "location": "Germany",
  "sector": "Employment"
}
```

**Evaluation:**
1. **Scope**: ✓ Provider in EU → Art 2(1)(a) applies
2. **AI System**: ✓ Automated filtering = AI
3. **High-Risk**:
   - Annex III Area 4(a) ✓
   - "Recruitment/selection" ✓
   - "Analyse and filter applications" ✓
   - Article 6(3) opt-out?
     - [LLM] "Not narrow procedural task" → NO
   - **Result: HIGH-RISK** (87% confidence)
4. **Obligations**: All of Chapter III applies
   - Article 9: Risk management required
   - Article 10: Data governance required
   - Article 13: Deployer information required
   - etc.

### Use Case 2: Chatbot for Customer Service

**Input:**
```json
{
  "system_description": "Customer service chatbot answering FAQ",
  "provider": "ServiceBot Inc",
  "location": "USA",
  "deployment": "EU customers"
}
```

**Evaluation:**
1. **Scope**: ✓ Art 2(1)(c) - output used in EU
2. **AI System**: ✓ Conversational AI
3. **High-Risk**: Check Annex III
   - Not biometrics
   - Not critical infrastructure
   - Not education
   - Not employment
   - Not essential services
   - Not law enforcement
   - Not migration
   - Not justice/democracy
   - **Result: NOT HIGH-RISK**
4. **But**: Article 50 transparency obligations may apply (deep fakes, emotional manipulation)
