## Extraction Rules

### What Counts as a Wirknorm:
1. **Prohibitions** - "shall be prohibited", "shall not"
2. **Obligations** - "shall", "must", "is required to"
3. **Classifications** - "shall be considered high-risk", "is classified as"
4. **Conditional Requirements** - "where X, then Y shall apply"

### What to Exclude:
1. Definitions (Article 3) - unless they trigger obligations
2. Governance structures (Board, Commission powers)
3. Procedural rules about regulators
4. Transitional provisions
5. Amendment procedures

### Grouping Logic:
- Group together ONLY if requirements are 100% identical
- Even one additional condition = separate group
- Track shared requirements (like "is AI system", "in scope", "is high-risk")
