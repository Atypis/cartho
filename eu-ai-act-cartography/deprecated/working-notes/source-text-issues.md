# Source Text Issues

## Article 5(1) Missing Text

### Problem
The MD source file appears to be missing the full text of:
- Article 5(1)(c) - believed to be about "social scoring" based on Recital 31
- Article 5(1)(h) - about "real-time remote biometric identification" based on Recitals 32-38 and extensive reference in Art 5(2)-(7)

### Evidence
1. Line 635: (b) ends
2. Lines 637-639: Show (i) and (ii) as sub-points - likely sub-points of missing (c)
3. Line 641: Jumps to (d)
4. Line 647: (g) ends
5. Lines 649-653: Show (i), (ii), (iii) as sub-points - likely exceptions to missing (h)

### Hypothesis from Context

**Article 5(1)(c)** likely prohibits:
- AI systems for "social scoring"
- With sub-conditions:
  - (i) detrimental treatment in unrelated contexts
  - (ii) unjustified/disproportionate treatment

**Article 5(1)(h)** likely prohibits:
- Real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement
- WITH exceptions for:
  - (i) search for crime victims, missing persons
  - (ii) prevention of imminent threats/terrorist attacks
  - (iii) localization of criminal suspects for serious offenses

### Resolution Strategy
1. Continue mapping with available text
2. Flag (c) and (h) as requiring source verification
3. Use Recitals and Art 5(2)-(7) to reconstruct (h) logic
4. Note confidence limitations

## Status
- Proceeding with mapping
- (c) and (h) marked as "source incomplete - inferred from context"
