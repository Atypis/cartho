      "The EU AI Act creates a multi-tiered system of legal consequences based on risk level: (1) Prohibited practices; (2) High-risk AI systems with comprehensive requirements; (3) Limited transparency obligations for certain AI systems; (4) General-purpose AI models with basic and enhanced (systemic risk) obligations.",

      "Article 5 prohibitions share a base structure (AI system + placing on market/service/use + in scope) but each has unique trigger conditions. Real-time remote biometric identification (Art 5(1)(h)) is not an absolute prohibition but a heavily restricted permission requiring multiple cumulative conditions.",

      "High-risk classification follows two pathways: (1) Safety components of products requiring third-party conformity assessment under Annex I legislation (Art 6(1)); (2) AI systems listed in Annex III use-cases (Art 6(2)), with derogation possibility under Art 6(3) if system does not materially influence outcome.",

      "Annex III creates 27 specific high-risk AI system consequences across 8 areas: (1) Biometrics; (2) Critical infrastructure; (3) Education; (4) Employment; (5) Essential services; (6) Law enforcement; (7) Migration/asylum/border control; (8) Administration of justice and democracy. Each has slightly different specific conditions.",

      "High-risk AI system requirements (Articles 9-15) apply cumulatively and must be implemented through the risk management system. These include: risk management, data governance, technical documentation, logging, transparency/instructions, human oversight, and accuracy/robustness/cybersecurity.",

      "Provider obligations (Article 16) create 12 distinct duties. Some obligations have conditional applicability (e.g., financial institutions may fulfill quality management through existing financial services law compliance - Art 17(4)).",

      "Value chain responsibility is complex: actors can become providers by putting their name/trademark on systems (Art 25(1)(a)), making substantial modifications (Art 25(1)(b)), or changing intended purpose to make system high-risk (Art 25(1)(c)). Product manufacturers become providers for safety component AI systems under specific conditions (Art 25(3)).",

      "Deployer obligations vary significantly based on: (1) General requirements (Art 26(1)-(12)); (2) Additional requirements for public authorities/Union institutions (registration - Art 26(8)); (3) Additional requirements for certain deployers (fundamental rights impact assessment - Art 27); (4) Specific requirements for post-remote biometric identification (Art 26(10)).",

      "Transparency obligations (Article 50) create 4 distinct consequence types: (1) Notification of AI interaction (Art 50(1)); (2) Notification of emotion recognition/biometric categorisation (Art 50(2)); (3) Technical detection enablement by providers (Art 50(3)); (4) Deep fake disclosure by deployers (Art 50(4)).",

      "General-purpose AI models have two obligation tiers: (1) Basic obligations for all models (Art 53) - documentation, downstream information, copyright policy, training summary; (2) Additional obligations for systemic risk models (Art 55) - model evaluation, systemic risk assessment/mitigation, incident reporting, cybersecurity. Free and open-source models have partial exemption (Art 53(2)) except for systemic risk models and except copyright/training summary obligations (Art 53(1)(c)-(d)).",

Grouped together as they share all requirements except the specific public interest objective.",

      "Annex III high-risk AI systems (27 distinct use-cases) could theoretically be grouped into fewer categories, but the specific conditions for each differ meaningfully. For instance, 'education access/admission' (point 3(a)), 'learning outcome evaluation' (point 3(b)), 'education level assessment' (point 3(c)), and 'student monitoring' (point 3(d)) all concern education but have distinct purposes and implications, warranting separate grouping.",

      "Article 25 (value chain responsibility shifts) creates multiple pathways for actors to become providers, but each pathway has unique conditions and triggers, preventing consolidation into a single group.",

      "Article 26 deployer obligations include both universal duties (Art 26(1)-(12)) and conditional duties based on deployer type (public authority registration, FRIA requirement) or system type (post-remote biometric identification). These are grouped separately due to different requirement profiles.",

      "General-purpose AI model obligations (Arts 53, 55) apply cumulatively for systemic risk models, but because basic obligations apply to all models while systemic risk obligations apply only to subset, they are grouped separately.",

      "Many obligations contain embedded exceptions or qualifications (e.g., financial institutions may fulfill certain obligations through existing compliance regimes - Art 17(4), 26(5), 26(6)). These are noted within groups rather than creating separate groups because the core obligation structure remains the same."
