# Question-Based System Implementation Log

## 2025-01-XX - Full Implementation

### Phase 1: Transformer ✓ COMPLETE
- Created question_transformer_v2.py with hand-crafted High-Risk schema
- Generated proper sequential codes (6.1.A, 6.1.B, 6.2.A, 6.2.B)
- Built consequence chains with yes/no flows
- 5 main questions covering both pathways

### Phase 2: Visualization ✓ COMPLETE
- Created questions.html with card-based interface
- Branch selector for OR pathways
- Question cards with sub-questions
- Answer buttons (Yes/No/Evaluate)
- Consequence arrows between questions
- Progress bar tracking
- Conclusion cards for final results

### Phase 3: Interactivity ✓ COMPLETE
- Answer tracking in memory
- Dynamic flow based on answers
- Visual feedback (green for yes, red for no)
- Auto-progression through questions
- Reset functionality

### Status: ✓ COMPLETE AND RUNNING

**What was built:**

1. **Question-Based Data Model**
   - Designed complete schema (question-based-schema.md)
   - Hand-crafted transformer for High-Risk Classification
   - 5 main questions with proper codes (6.1.A, 6.1.B, 6.2.A, 6.2.B)
   - Yes/No consequences with proper flow logic

2. **Interactive Evaluation UI**
   - Branch selector for OR pathways (Product Safety vs Annex III)
   - Question cards with metadata, sub-questions, notes
   - Answer buttons (Yes/No/Evaluate with LLM)
   - Dynamic flow based on answers
   - Consequence arrows showing progression
   - Final conclusion cards (HIGH-RISK vs NOT HIGH-RISK)
   - Progress bar
   - Reset functionality

3. **API Endpoints**
   - /api/questions/high-risk-classification - serves question schema
   - /questions - evaluation interface

**Access:**
- Tree View: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
- Question Flow: http://127.0.0.1:5000/questions

**Next Steps (Future):**
- LLM integration for evaluation buttons
- Answer persistence (database)
- Export to PDF/Gutachten format
- More detailed Annex III breakdown
- Additional requirements beyond High-Risk
