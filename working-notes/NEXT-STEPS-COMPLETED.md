# Next Steps - COMPLETED

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: ✅ All next steps from Wirknormen extraction completed

---

## Tasks Completed

### 1. ✅ Mapped Annex III Use Cases
**File**: [`eu-ai-act-cartography/wirknormen-catalog/annex-iii-high-risk-use-cases.json`](../eu-ai-act-cartography/wirknormen-catalog/annex-iii-high-risk-use-cases.json)

- Mapped all 28 high-risk AI system use cases across 8 areas
- Documented registration variations (EU database vs. national vs. secure non-public)
- Noted exclusions for each use case
- Linked to triggering Wirknorm (W-003b)

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "areas": {
    "1": "Biometrics" (3 use cases),
    "2": "Critical Infrastructure" (1 use case - NATIONAL registration),
    "3": "Education" (4 use cases),
    "4": "Employment" (2 use cases),
    "5": "Public/Private Services" (4 use cases),
    "6": "Law Enforcement" (5 use cases - SECURE registration),
    "7": "Migration/Asylum/Border" (4 use cases - SECURE registration),
    "8": "Justice/Democracy" (2 use cases)
  }
}
```

### 2. ✅ Built Shared Requirements Library
**Integrated into**: [`eu-ai-act-cartography/wirknormen-catalog/wirknormen-complete-catalog.json`](../eu-ai-act-cartography/wirknormen-catalog/wirknormen-complete-catalog.json)

Created 11 reusable shared requirements (SR-001 through SR-010):

- **SR-001**: Is AI System
- **SR-002**: Is Provider
- **SR-003**: Is Deployer
- **SR-004**: Is High-Risk (with sub-pathways SR-004a, SR-004b)
- **SR-005**: System Placed on Market or Put Into Service
- **SR-006**: Is General-Purpose AI Model Provider
- **SR-007**: Is Importer
- **SR-008**: Is Distributor
- **SR-009**: Third-Country Establishment
- **SR-010**: Is Systemic Risk Model (with SR-010a, SR-010b)

Each shared requirement includes:
- Unique ID
- Name
- Description
- Article reference
- Question (for interactive use)
- Operator (if composite)
- Children (if hierarchical)

### 3. ✅ Created Complete Requirement Trees
**File**: [`eu-ai-act-cartography/wirknormen-catalog/wirknormen-complete-catalog.json`](../eu-ai-act-cartography/wirknormen-catalog/wirknormen-complete-catalog.json)

Built complete decision trees for key Wirknormen with logical operators:

**Example - W-003b (High-Risk Classification via Annex III)**:
```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "operator": "AND",
    "conditions": [
      {"ref": "SR-001"},  // Is AI System
      {"ref": "SR-004b-1"},  // Matches Annex III use case
      {
        "operator": "AND_NOT",  // Exception: Article 6(3) opt-out
        "conditions": [...]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Operators implemented**:
- **AND**: Cumulative requirements (all must be true)
- **OR**: Alternative requirements (any can be true)
- **AND_NOT**: Exceptions/negations (condition must NOT be true)

**Detailed trees provided for**:
- W-001: AI Literacy
- W-002a: Subliminal Manipulation Prohibition
- W-003b: High-Risk Classification
- W-007: Risk Management System
- W-014: Provider Core Obligations (12 sub-obligations)
- W-024: Deployer Core Obligations (12 sub-obligations)
- W-038: General-Purpose AI Model Core Obligations (4 sub-obligations)
- W-040: Systemic Risk Model Additional Obligations (4 sub-obligations)
- W-041: Real-World Testing Requirements (11 conditions)
- W-046: Post-Market Monitoring
- W-047: Serious Incident Reporting
- W-049: Right to Explanation

### 4. ✅ Developed Interactive Selector Tool
**File**: [`eu-ai-act-cartography/wirknormen_selector.py`](../eu-ai-act-cartography/wirknormen_selector.py)

Created fully functional Python CLI tool with:

**Features**:
- Interactive question-based flow
- High-risk classification determination (both Article 6 pathways)
- Annex III use case matching
- Article 6(3) opt-out checking
- Systemic risk model classification
- Requirement tree evaluation with logical operators
- Results categorization (Prohibitions, Technical Requirements, Provider/Deployer obligations, etc.)
- JSON report export

**Capabilities**:
- Recursively evaluates complex requirement trees
- Handles AND/OR/AND_NOT operators
- Asks only necessary questions based on previous answers
- Shows detailed consequences, penalties, and timelines
- Displays obligations for umbrella Wirknormen (W-014, W-024, W-038, W-040)

**Usage**:
```bash
cd eu-ai-act-cartography
python3 wirknormen_selector.py
```

### 5. ✅ Final Grouping Analysis
**Integrated into catalog metadata**

Analyzed Wirknormen by shared requirements:

**Group A - All High-Risk Provider Requirements**:
- Wirknormen: W-007 through W-020, W-027 through W-030, W-046 through W-048
- Shared: SR-002 (Is Provider) + SR-004 (Is High-Risk)
- Total: ~20 obligations

**Group B - General-Purpose AI Models**:
- Wirknormen: W-036 through W-040
- Shared: SR-006 (Is General-Purpose AI Model Provider)
- Systemic Risk subset: W-037, W-040

**Group C - Transparency Requirements**:
- Wirknormen: W-032 through W-035b
- Different contexts but same transparency purpose

**Group D - Registration Requirements**:
- Wirknormen: W-031a through W-031e
- Different databases/procedures based on use case
