# Wirknormen Checkpoint: Articles 47-60

**Progress**: Lines 1585-1984 completed
**Status**: Continuing systematic extraction

## Key Wirknormen from Articles 47-60

### Article 47 - EU Declaration of Conformity

### Article 53 - General-Purpose AI Model Obligations
**W-038**: Provider of general-purpose AI model has 4 core obligations:
- (a) Draw up/keep technical documentation (Annex XI)
- (b) Provide information to downstream providers (Annex XII)
- (c) Implement copyright compliance policy

- (c) Track/document/report serious incidents
- (d) Ensure adequate cybersecurity protection

### Articles 57-60 - Sandboxes & Real-World Testing
**No Wirknormen for operators** - These establish regulatory sandbox framework and testing procedures, not direct obligations for providers/deployers outside sandbox participation

---

## Articles NOT Creating Operator Wirknormen (Articles 47-60)

- Article 46: Derogation procedures (emergency authorization, not operator obligation)
- Article 56: Codes of practice (AI Office framework)
- Article 57-59: AI regulatory sandboxes (voluntary participation framework)
- Article 60: Real-world testing (incomplete in this reading session)

---

## Running Count

**Total Wirknormen Identified**: ~40 (W-001 through W-040)
**Articles Completed**: 4-60 (57 articles, Article 60 incomplete)
**Lines Read**: 617-1984 (~1,367 lines of 3,672 total)
**Progress**: ~37% of Act completed

---

## Next Steps

**Continue from**: Line 1984 (Article 60 continuation)
**Remaining**: Articles 60-113 (~56 articles)
**Focus areas ahead**:
- Article 60-68: Real-world testing, AI Office governance
- Articles 69-85: Post-market monitoring, enforcement, penalties, confidentiality
- Articles 86-113: EU database, market surveillance, delegated acts, transitional rules

## Key Patterns Observed

### Registration Complexity (Article 49)
- Different registration regimes based on system type and use case
- EU database for most Annex III systems
- Secure non-public section for law enforcement/migration/asylum/border
- National registration for employment systems
- Even Article 6(3) opt-out systems must register

### Transparency Obligations (Article 50)
- Multiple distinct obligations for different content types
- Provider obligations: inform about AI interaction, mark synthetic content
- Deployer obligations: disclose emotion recognition/biometric categorisation, disclose deep fakes, disclose AI-generated public interest text
- Consistent exception: systems authorized for criminal law enforcement

### General-Purpose AI Models (Articles 51-55)
- Two-tier system: basic obligations (W-038) + systemic risk obligations (W-040)
- 10^25 FLOPs threshold creates presumption of systemic risk
- Open-source carve-out for basic obligations, but NOT for systemic risk models
- Third-country providers need EU representatives

### Compliance Flexibility
- Codes of practice as alternative to harmonised standards (Articles 53, 55)
- Commission can approve codes via implementing acts
- Until standards/codes available, providers must demonstrate "alternative adequate means"
